    <!-- The assignment details indicated we needed an external js file. A fellow student suggested I research querySelector and innerHTML and after a long day of trial and error I found a way to drastically reduce the js code. I hope that's ok. If not, I can go back and create separate files. Also I promise I'll commit more as I work moving forward.  Spending my college time as a journalism major instilled a strong instinct to keep editing and polishing a paper/project and only submit once it was as pretty as possible.-->
